# System In-App Functions
The CleverTap iOS SDK (v7.2.0 and above) supports a set of built-in system in-app functions. These can be triggered either via in-app notification button actions or launched as stand-alone campaigns. For more details, refer to the [CleverTap Documentation](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/)

| :bulb:  Apple limits amount of time you can prompt app review to three times in one year, also avoid showing a request for a review immediately when a user launches your app, even if it isnâ€™t the first time it launches. Refer to the [apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/requesting-app-store-reviews#Overview) for more details. |
